# Quantum Tourism
Creation of Graph-database of tourism data and implementation of Machine Learning, AI and Quantum Computing Algorithms in the complex network and graph data.

# Data Sources
A sample experimental data includes the (1) geographical location of the tourist spots, hotels, resturents, trcking sites, temples, hotels, musiums etc as nodes(properties) (2) travel cost from node A to nod B, types of travel methods as edge (characterists) data (3) Travellers are random migrators from node to node.

# Objective
Finding experimental cost optimized travel/tour package for different category of tours (religious tour, natural scenary, cultural exploration etc)
