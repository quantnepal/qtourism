### Data Sources:
A sample experimental data includes the (1) geographical location of the tourist spots, hotels, restaurants, trekking sites, temples, hotels, museums, etc as nodes(properties) (2) travel cost from node A to node B, types of travel methods as edge (characteristics) data (3) Travellers are random migrators from node to node.

### Objective
Finding experimental cost-optimized travel/tour package for different categories of tours (religious tour, natural scenery, cultural exploration, etc)
